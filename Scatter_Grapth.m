function varargout = Scatter_Grapth(varargin)
% SCATTER_GRAPTH M-file for Scatter_Grapth.fig
%      SCATTER_GRAPTH, by itself, creates a new SCATTER_GRAPTH or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = SCATTER_GRAPTH returns the handle to a new SCATTER_GRAPTH or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      SCATTER_GRAPTH('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in SCATTER_GRAPTH.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      SCATTER_GRAPTH('Property','Value',...) creates a new SCATTER_GRAPTH or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Scatter_Grapth_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Scatter_Grapth_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
