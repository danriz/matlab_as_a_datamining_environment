function varargout = Neural_Network(varargin)
% NEURAL_NETWORK M-file for Neural_Network.fig
%      NEURAL_NETWORK, by itself, creates a new NEURAL_NETWORK or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = NEURAL_NETWORK returns the handle to a new NEURAL_NETWORK or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      NEURAL_NETWORK('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in NEURAL_NETWORK.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      NEURAL_NETWORK('Property','Value',...) creates a new NEURAL_NETWORK or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Neural_Network_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Neural_Network_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
